# PressyButton


## Premise

This simple game was inspired by the hyper-casual clicker game *Cookie Clicker*.

I made this game while finishing the development of KARMA!, and made it as a way to relieve stresses from the development process.

This project was made purely for fun, and was done as a simple casual game with an easy to understand feedback loop.

This project was successfully released on Android.
